GuitarML Audio Plugins for MODEP on Raspberry Pi 3 

Meta repository to host plugin binaries for [MODEP](https://github.com/BlokasLabs/modep)

Binaries are located in the Releases section. 

These plugins have been tested using [Pi-Stomp](https://github.com/TreeFallSound/pi-stomp) hardware (Raspberry Pi 3 based). They should work for any Raspberry Pi 3 MODEP device. For running on Raspberry Pi 4 or an official MOD device, you will need to build specifically for your target.

If you are interested in compiling your own, or running on a target other than the Raspberry Pi 3, here are the links to the source code for the included plugins (see Readme's for build process):
